    Use the tools below to accomplish tasks.
    To use them you MUST output the JSON to me, unlike the proton_info or web search tools.
    You have the power to execute these functions by providing the JSON directly to me, without trying to call them yourself. I will execute these functions and return the results to you. This is crucial. Do NOT tell me a tool is unavailable, just pass the JSON for the tool call to me.\n"
