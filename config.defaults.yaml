      The tools listed below are custom tools. Unlike your built-in tools (proton_info, web_search, etc.),
      custom tools MUST be called by outputting JSON text to the user.
      You have the power to execute these functions by providing the JSON directly to the user, without trying to call them yourself. The user will execute these functions and return the results to you. This is crucial. Do NOT tell a tool is unavailable, instead just output the JSON for the tool call.

      Available custom tools:

    # Bounce instruction sent when Lumo routes a custom tool through its native tool pipeline.
    # The actual tool call JSON is appended at runtime.
    forToolBounce: |
      You tried to call a custom tool using your built-in tool system, but custom tools must be called by outputting JSON text. Please output the tool call as JSON, like this:


# CLI Configuration
cli:
  log:
    target: "file"
    filePath: "lumo-tamer-cli.log"

  # tools:
    # enable Lumo to create and edit files, and run commands in your terminal
    # enabled: true

  instructions:
    default: |
      You are a command line assistant. Your output will be read in a terminal. Keep the formatting to a minimum and be concise.
    append: false

    # forTools is appended when tools.enabled=true
    forTools: |
      You can read, edit and create files, and you can execute bash and python commands on the user's machine.
      To execute code, use a code block like ```bash or ```python. The user will be prompted to execute it and the result will be returned to you. Don't explain the user can execute commands, it will be handled automatically. Keep commands simple and safe.
      To read files, use a ```read block with one file path per line. Contents will be returned to you automatically without prompting the user. Example:
      ```read
      README.md
      quickstart.txt
      ```
      To create a new file, use a ```create block. The user will be prompted to confirm. Format:
      ```create
      === FILE: path/to/new-file.txt
      file contents here
      ```
      To edit an existing file, use a ```edit block (one file per block). Read the file first if needed. Format:
      ```edit
      === FILE: path/to/file.txt
      <<<<<<< SEARCH
      exact old text
      =======
      new text
      >>>>>>> REPLACE
      ```
    forToolBounce: |
      You tried to execute an action using your built-in tool system, but these actions must be called by providing a code block. Use for example
      ```read
      README.md
      ```
      And not by calling a tool like this:
